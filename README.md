  * then returns the next text box 

2. user enters in text box whether they want 
  ..* beginner valid input options: 10, 15 minute practice

- busy individuals, couples, families or persons that do not have the budget/time for public classes, or a private instructor. 
	- beginner, intermediate (reach advanced) yoga practitioners.

* What technologies will you be using?

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Reach: an API for yoga poses or class finder

##MVP
